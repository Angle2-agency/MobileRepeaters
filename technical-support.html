                    Please follow the Mobile Repeater instructions attached and below to the letter.<br/><br/>
                    First - Make sure your handset is set to 2G only as this means we will be working on voice and not have any conflicting 3G signals.<br/><br/>
                    Please see link below to locate your nearest base station. This is will help identify where the signal comes from, you can also walk around the house and see which side has the strongest signal levels using software below or the bars on the handset as this is usually the easiest to do.<br/><br/>
                    Point your outdoor antenna in the general direction of the best signal, make sure it is pointing outwards and not down or to the sky please check the results and amend as necessary, usually by rotating by 45 degrees to check results (try and ensure repeater is off whilst you change outdoor aerial direction especially in built up areas)

                                If you have android phone you can download application from play market which will allow you to measure signal strength. Try to find steady signal on your phone and make sure it is not fluctuating up and down after your installation.
